    "A coroutine is a special type of function that can **pause and resume its execution**. Unlike a regular function that runs from start to finish without interruption, a coroutine can temporarily stop itself when it encounters an operation that takes time to complete. This includes reading a file from a disk or making a network request. This “pause” allows the program to do other things instead of waiting idly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're cooking dinner and the recipe calls for boiling water. Instead of just staring at the pot until it boils (a regular function), you put the lid on and walk away to chop some vegetables (the program doing other work). When the water finally boils, you can come back and continue with the next step of the recipe—like adding pasta. The coroutine is like the cook who can efficiently multitask by pausing one task to start another.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the long-running operation is done, the coroutine is “woken up” and resumes exactly where it left off, completing the rest of its code. This ability to pause and resume is the key to achieving **concurrency**, allowing a single program to manage many tasks efficiently without blocking or freezing."

    "\n",
    "The most important thing about **`asyncio.run()`** is that it serves as the primary **entry point** for an `asyncio` application. Think of it as the **`main()`** function in a traditional program. It's the one call that kicks off everything else. It's not designed to run multiple, unrelated coroutines at the same time. Instead, it runs a single, top-level coroutine, and that one coroutine is responsible for launching and managing all other concurrent tasks.\n",

    "### The Role of the Entry Coroutine\n",

    "The single coroutine you pass to `asyncio.run()` is your application's starting point.  This main coroutine will then use `asyncio` functions like **`asyncio.gather()`** or **`asyncio.create_task()`** to create and execute other coroutines. This is how you harness `asyncio`'s **concurrency**—by delegating tasks from the main coroutine to other, more specific ones. This design ensures that all concurrent operations are properly managed within a single, cohesive event loop created by `asyncio.run()`, preventing common issues with unmanaged asynchronous code. As you build more complex `asyncio` applications, you'll consistently use this pattern, with `asyncio.run()` as the reliable starting point for all your asynchronous logic."

Before Python 3.5 introduced `async` and `await`, `yield from` was the primary way to delegate control to a nested coroutine.

    "\n",
    "6.  Inside `task2`, the code hits **`await asyncio.sleep(1)`**. `task2` pauses and yields control back to the event loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  The event loop continues to monitor both tasks. After **1 second** passes, the event loop notices that `task2`'s sleep is complete. It **resumes** `task2` from where it left off. `task2` prints \"world\" and finishes.\n",

    "\n",
    "9.  Now that both `task1` and `task2` are finished, the event loop returns control to the `main()` coroutine, which had been paused at `await task1`. Since `task1` is now complete, `main()` continues.\n",

    "10. The code then reaches **`await task2`**. Since `task2` is already complete, this `await` returns immediately without pausing.\n",

    "## Creating `Tasks`\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Task` in `asyncio` is a fundamental building block for running coroutines concurrently on an event loop. A `Task` is a **wrapper around a coroutine** that schedules its execution. Creating a `Task` doesn't run the coroutine immediately; it just puts it on the event loop's to-do list, allowing the event loop to manage its execution alongside other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### What a `Task` Does\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of a `Task` is to enable true concurrency. When you have multiple coroutines you want to run at the same time, you wrap each one in a `Task`. This allows the event loop to switch between them whenever an `await` is encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an `asyncio.Task` as a lightweight thread or a job ticket.  You don't manage the execution yourself; you hand the \"job\" (the coroutine) to the event loop by creating a task. The event loop's job is to make sure all these tickets are processed efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key benefit of `Task` is that it allows for **cancellation**. You can programmatically cancel a `Task`, and `asyncio` will handle the cleanup. This is crucial for managing long-running operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Creating and Running Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "You typically create a task using `asyncio.create_task()`. The function takes a coroutine object and returns a `Task` object.\n",

    "asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `asyncio.run(main())` starts the event loop and runs the `main()` coroutine.\n",
    "2.  Inside `main()`, `asyncio.create_task()` is called for `worker('A', 3)` and `worker('B', 1)`. This **schedules** both coroutines to be run by the event loop but **does not block** `main()`.\n",
    "3.  The `main()` coroutine then reaches `await task1`. This pauses `main()` and yields control back to the event loop.\n",
    "4.  The event loop now has two tasks it can run: `task1` and `task2`. It switches between them as they encounter `await` calls (in this case, `await asyncio.sleep()`).\n",
    "5.  `task2` finishes first (after 1 second).\n",
    "6.  `task1` finishes after 3 seconds.\n",
    "7.  Once `task1` and `task2` are both done, the event loop resumes `main()`. `main()` gets the results from the tasks and prints them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `asyncio.create_task()` is the preferred way to run a coroutine in the background, as it gives you a `Task` object that you can use to manage the coroutine's lifecycle, get its result, or cancel it."

    "## Canceling a `Task`\n",
    "\n",
    "To cancel an `asyncio` task, you call the **`.cancel()`** method on the `Task` object. This doesn't stop the task immediately but instead schedules it for cancellation by raising an **`asyncio.CancelledError`** inside the coroutine at its next `await` point.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works and What to Expect\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Call `.cancel()`**: When you call `task.cancel()`, you're essentially sending a cancellation signal. The task's `_asyncio.CancelledError` flag is set, and the event loop is notified.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`CancelledError` Injection**: The event loop continues running until the cancelled task next `awaits` something. At that point, the `asyncio.CancelledError` exception is injected and raised within the coroutine.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Coroutine Handles Exception**: The coroutine should be prepared to catch this exception. A `try...except asyncio.CancelledError` block allows the coroutine to run any necessary cleanup code, such as closing files or database connections, before it terminates. If a coroutine doesn't handle the exception, it will propagate up and cause the task to terminate abruptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Awaiting the Canceled Task**: To ensure the cancellation process is complete, you can `await` the task you just cancelled. This `await` will re-raise the `CancelledError`, which you can catch to confirm the task is done.\n",

    "### You can not cancel a `Task` when it is running plain python\n",
    "\n",
    "Something important to note about cancellation is that a `CancelledError` can only be thrown from an `await` statement. This means that if you call `cancel()` on a task while it is executing plain Python code, that code will run until completion. The `CancelledError` will only be raised when the task hits its next `await` statement. Calling `cancel()` won't magically stop the task in its tracks; it will only stop the task if you're currently at an `await` point or its next `await` point.\n",

    "\n",
    "### How Cancellation Works: The Await Point\n",

    "Cancellation in `asyncio` is **cooperative**, not preemptive. A task must \"cooperate\" by reaching an `await` point to allow the `CancelledError` to be raised. This design choice is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the program's state. It ensures that a task can't be abruptly terminated while in the middle of a critical operation, like updating a database or writing a file, which could lead to data corruption.\n",

    "3.  `main()` calls `task.cancel()`.\n",
    "4.  The `CancelledError` is now pending, but it's not raised yet because `worker_with_await` is running its `cpu_intensive_operation`, which does not have any `await` statements. The CPU-intensive loop runs for its full 3 seconds.\n",
    "5.  After the `cpu_intensive_task` finishes, the `worker_with_await` coroutine hits its next `await` point: `await asyncio.sleep(5)`.\n",
    "6.  It is at this **precise moment** that the pending `CancelledError` is finally raised. The `try...except` block catches it, prints the message, and the task ends gracefully. The `asyncio.sleep(5)` never actually runs.\n",
    "7.  Finally, `await task` in `main()` completes, and the program exits, confirming the cancellation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Note:** This example clearly shows that `cancel()` is a **request**, not a command. The task itself decides when to honor that request by hitting an `await` point."

    "## Setting a `timeout` for a `Task`\n",
    "\n",
    "You use `asyncio.wait_for` to set a time limit on an asynchronous operation. It's a high-level `asyncio` function that runs a coroutine and cancels it if it doesn't finish within the specified timeout. This is essential for preventing a single operation from blocking your entire application indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use `asyncio.wait_for`\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax is `await asyncio.wait_for(coro, timeout)`, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `coro` is the **awaitable object** you want to run with a time limit (a coroutine, a `Task`, or a `Future`).\n",
    "  - `timeout` is a **number** of seconds (an `int` or `float`) after which the operation will be cancelled. If the `timeout` is `None`, the function will wait forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the operation completes within the timeout, `asyncio.wait_for` returns its result. If the timeout expires, it cancels the task and raises an **`asyncio.TimeoutError`**. This means you must use a `try...except` block to handle a potential timeout.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Operation Completes in Time\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a \"fast\" task finishes before the timeout, so `wait_for` returns the result without raising an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def fast_operation():\n",
    "    print(\"Fast operation is starting...\")\n",
    "    await asyncio.sleep(1) # This is less than the 3-second timeout\n",
    "    return \"Operation complete!\"\n",

    "    try:\n",
    "        print(\"Waiting for fast operation...\")\n",
    "        result = await asyncio.wait_for(fast_operation(), timeout=3)\n",
    "        print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n",
    "    except asyncio.TimeoutError:\n",
    "        print(\"Error: The operation timed out.\")\n",

    "Result: Operation complete!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Operation Exceeds the Timeout\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, a \"slow\" task takes longer than the timeout, causing `wait_for` to raise a `TimeoutError`. The `try...except` block catches this error and handles the cancellation.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## `Futures` in `ayncio`\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Future` in `asyncio` is a special low-level object that represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. Unlike a coroutine, a `Future` doesn't contain any code to be executed. It's a placeholder for a result that will be set at a later time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a **`Future` as a promise**: a promise that a result will be available in the future. You can check if the promise has been fulfilled, wait for it to be, or attach a callback function to run once it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics of a `Future`\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **State:** A `Future` can be in one of several states: `PENDING`, `RUNNING`, `DONE`, or `CANCELLED`.\n",
    "  * **Result or Exception:** Once a `Future` is marked as `DONE`, it holds either a return value (`future.result()`) or an exception (`future.exception()`).\n",
    "  * **Awaits:** A `Future` is an **awaitable object**. This means you can use the `await` keyword on a `Future` to pause your coroutine until the `Future`'s result is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you won't typically create `Future` objects manually in application code, they are a fundamental part of the `asyncio` framework. High-level functions like `asyncio.create_task()` and `asyncio.wait()` use `Future` objects under the hood to manage and report on the status of coroutines.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Manual Creation and Use\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how a `Future` can be used to coordinate between two parts of an asynchronous program: a `worker` that performs a task and a `main` coroutine that waits for the result.\n",

    "    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate I/O work\n",
    "    print(\"Worker: Operation complete. Setting result on Future.\")\n",
    "    # Set the result on the future, fulfilling the promise\n",
    "    future.set_result(\"Data successfully processed!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    # Create an empty Future object\n",
    "    my_future = asyncio.Future()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a task to run the worker and pass the Future to it\n",
    "    awaitable_task = asyncio.create_task(\n",
    "        worker(my_future)\n",
    "    )\n",

    "    print(\"Main: Waiting for the Future to have a result...\")\n",
    "    # Await the Future directly. This pauses main() until the result is set.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    print(f\"Main: Future's result is: '{result}'\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the main coroutine\n",
    "asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `main()` creates an `asyncio.Future()` object called `my_future`. It's currently in a `PENDING` state.\n",
    "2.  `main()` creates a task to run the `worker` coroutine and passes the `my_future` object to it.\n",
    "3.  `main()` then hits `await my_future`. Since the `Future` is not yet done, `main()` **pauses**, yielding control back to the event loop.\n",
    "4.  The event loop now runs the `worker` task. The worker sleeps for 2 seconds, and then calls `my_future.set_result()`. This action **fulfills the promise**, and the `Future`'s state changes from `PENDING` to `DONE`.\n",
    "5.  Since the `Future` is now done, the event loop resumes the `main()` coroutine, which had been paused at `await my_future`.\n",
    "6.  `await my_future` returns the result that was set on it, which is then printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example, while simplified, shows the core principle: a `Future` acts as a coordination point for a result that is computed asynchronously, allowing other parts of your code to wait for it in a non-blocking manner."

    "## `Task`, `Future` and `Awaitable` relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "In `asyncio`, **`Task`**, **`Future`**, and **`Awaitable`** are all interconnected concepts that work together to enable asynchronous programming. The simplest way to understand their relationship is to see them as a hierarchy: an `Awaitable` is the most general term, a `Future` is a specific type of `Awaitable`, and a `Task` is a special `Future` that wraps a coroutine.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Awaitable\n",
    "\n",
    "An **awaitable** is any object that can be used with the `await` keyword. This is the broadest category. It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Coroutines**: Functions defined with `async def`.\n",
    "* **Futures**: Objects that represent a result that will be available in the future.\n",
    "* **Tasks**: A special type of `Future` used to schedule a coroutine.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can **`await`** any of these objects. For example, `await my_coroutine()`, `await my_future`, or `await my_task` are all valid.\n",

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future\n",
    "\n",
    "A **`Future`** (`asyncio.Future`) is an awaitable object that acts as a placeholder for an eventual result. It doesn't contain any code to be executed, but its state can be monitored. You can set a result (`future.set_result()`) or an exception (`future.set_exception()`) on it, at which point its state changes to `DONE`. This fulfills the \"promise\" of the future and unblocks any coroutines that are `await`ing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "A **`Task`** (`asyncio.Task`) is a subclass of `Future` and is the most common object you'll work with in `asyncio`. A `Task` is created by wrapping a coroutine with `asyncio.create_task()`. It serves two primary purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  It **schedules the coroutine** to run on the event loop.\n",
    "2.  It acts as a `Future`, allowing you to `await` it to get the coroutine's final result or exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the relationship like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **You write a coroutine** (`async def`). It's the code you want to run.\n",
    "* You use **`asyncio.create_task()` to create a `Task`** that wraps your coroutine. This is how you tell the event loop to run your code concurrently.\n",
    "* The `Task` itself is a **`Future`**. You can **`await`** it to get the result of the coroutine it's running.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hierarchy is: **`Task`** is a specialized **`Future`**, and both are types of **`Awaitable`**.\n",
