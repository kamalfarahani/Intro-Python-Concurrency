    "A coroutine is a special type of function that can **pause and resume its execution**. Unlike a regular function that runs from start to finish without interruption, a coroutine can temporarily stop itself when it encounters an operation that takes time to complete. This includes reading a file from a disk or making a network request. This “pause” allows the program to do other things instead of waiting idly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're cooking dinner and the recipe calls for boiling water. Instead of just staring at the pot until it boils (a regular function), you put the lid on and walk away to chop some vegetables (the program doing other work). When the water finally boils, you can come back and continue with the next step of the recipe—like adding pasta. The coroutine is like the cook who can efficiently multitask by pausing one task to start another.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the long-running operation is done, the coroutine is “woken up” and resumes exactly where it left off, completing the rest of its code. This ability to pause and resume is the key to achieving **concurrency**, allowing a single program to manage many tasks efficiently without blocking or freezing."

    "\n",
    "Creating a coroutine is simple, just like defining a regular function, but you use the keyword **`async`** before **`def`**. This small change is what tells Python the function is a coroutine, allowing it to be paused and resumed.\n",

    "To run a coroutine in Python, you can't simply call it like a regular function. Coroutines need to be executed by an event loop, which is a special program that manages and schedules the execution of asynchronous tasks.
