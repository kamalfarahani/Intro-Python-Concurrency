    "### Parent child processes\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science and operating systems, the terms “parent” and “child” processes are used to describe the relationship between two processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A process is an instance of a program that is being executed. It represents a running program along with its current state, including variables, memory, and other resources. When a program is executed, an operating system creates a process to run the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "A parent process is a process that creates another process, known as the child process. The parent process typically initiates the creation of the child process by using a system call, such as “fork” in Unix-like operating systems. The parent process is responsible for managing and controlling the child process.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a parent process creates a child process, the child process inherits certain attributes from the parent, such as the environment variables, open files, and the memory space. However, **the child process has its own unique process identifier (PID) and runs independently of the parent process**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between a parent process and a child process is often referred to as a “parent-child relationship.” The parent process can monitor the execution of the child process, communicate with it, and perform other operations such as terminating or signaling it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that a parent process can have multiple child processes, forming a hierarchical structure. This allows for the creation of complex systems and the execution of concurrent tasks.\n",

    "### Creating processes in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can create processes using the `multiprocessing` module, which provides a way to spawn child processes and communicate with them. Here's an example that demonstrates how to create processes in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker():\n",
    "    \"\"\"Function to be executed by the child process\"\"\"\n",
    "    print(f'Worker process executing with PID: {os.getpid()}')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    # Create a new process\n",
    "    process = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Start the process\n",
    "    process.start()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(f'Parent process executing with PID: {os.getpid()}')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Wait for the process to complete\n",
    "    process.join()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a function called `worker()` that represents the task to be executed by the child process. The function simply prints a message indicating that it is executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block,  we create a new process using the `multiprocessing.Process` constructor. We pass the `target` argument with the function `worker`, which specifies the function to be executed by the child process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we start the process by calling the `start()` method on the process object. This will spawn a new process that executes the `worker` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "After starting the process, we call the `join()` method to wait for the child process to complete. This ensures that the parent process waits until the child process finishes its execution before continuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we print a message indicating that the parent process is executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this Python script, you'll see the output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Worker process executing with PID: 5092\n",
    "Parent process executing with PID: 3868\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates the basic process creation and execution flow in Python using the `multiprocessing` module. You can extend this example to perform more complex tasks and communication between processes using various features provided by the module."

    "### Passing arguments to Process functions\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating processes in Python using the `multiprocessing` module, you can pass arguments to the target function of the process. There are a few different ways to pass arguments, depending on your specific requirements. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Positional Arguments**:\n",
    "You can pass positional arguments to the target function by specifying them as additional arguments when creating the `Process` object. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker(name, age):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Function to be executed by the child process\"\"\"\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, we pass two positional arguments, `'John'` and `25`, to the `worker()` function by specifying them in the `args` parameter when creating the `Process` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Keyword Arguments**:\n",
    "You can also pass keyword arguments to the target function using the `kwargs` parameter when creating the `Process` object. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker(name, age):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Function to be executed by the child process\"\"\"\n",

    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    # Create a new process with keyword arguments\n",
    "    process = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, kwargs={'name': 'John', 'age': 25})\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Start the process\n",
    "    process.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Wait for the process to complete\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we pass the arguments `'name': 'John'` and `'age': 25` to the `worker()` function using the `kwargs` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combination of Positional and Keyword Arguments**:\n",
    "You can combine both positional and keyword arguments when creating the `Process` object. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker(name, age):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Function to be executed by the child process\"\"\"\n",
    "    print(f\"Worker process executing with name: {name} and age: {age}\")\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, we pass the positional argument `'John'` and the keyword argument `'age': 25` to the `worker()` function.\n",

    "### Communicating with another process and sharing data\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that processes are typically **isolated from each other and run in separate memory spaces**. This isolation ensures that each process has its own independent memory and does not interfere with the memory of other processes. This isolation is a fundamental feature of operating systems and is key to ensuring stability, security, and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this process isolation, you cannot directly share data between processes in Python. Each process has its own memory space, and modifications made to variables in one process do not affect the variables in another process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable communication and data sharing between processes, you need to use specific mechanisms provided by Python's multiprocessing module, such as pipes, queues, or shared memory. These mechanisms facilitate inter-process communication (IPC) by providing ways to exchange data or share memory regions between processes.\n",

    "Using these IPC mechanisms ensures that data is safely and efficiently transferred between processes without violating the process isolation. They handle the necessary synchronization and communication protocols required for inter-process communication.\n",

    "#### 3. Shared Memory:\n",
    "Shared memory allows multiple processes to access the **same region of memory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `multiprocessing` module of Python, the `Value` and `Array` classes are provided to create shared memory objects that can be accessed and modified by multiple processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `multiprocessing.Value`: This class allows you to create a shared variable of a specific type. The `Value` class takes two arguments: the data type of the variable and its initial value. The supported data types are `'b'` (boolean), `'i'` (integer), `'d'` (double-precision float), and `'c'` (character).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here's an example that creates a shared integer variable using `Value`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from multiprocessing import Process, Value\n",
    "\n",
    "def increment_counter(counter):\n",
    "   counter.value += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "   counter = Value('i', 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "   processes = []\n",
    "   for _ in range(5):\n",
    "       process = Process(target=increment_counter, args=(counter,))\n",
    "       processes.append(process)\n",
    "       process.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "   for process in processes:\n",
    "       process.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(\"Counter value:\", counter.value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a shared integer variable named `counter` is created with an initial value of 0. The `increment_counter` function is defined to increment the value of `counter` by 1. Multiple processes are created, and each process calls the `increment_counter` function, passing the shared `counter` variable as an argument. After all the processes finish, the final value of `counter` is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `multiprocessing.Array`: This class allows you to create a shared array of a specific type. The `Array` class takes two arguments: the data type of the array and its initial values. The supported data types for the array are the same as those for `Value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `Array` to create a shared array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from multiprocessing import Process, Array\n",
    "\n",
    "def square_numbers(numbers):\n",
    "   for i in range(len(numbers)):\n",
    "       numbers[i] = numbers[i] ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "   shared_numbers = Array('i', numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "   processes = []\n",
    "   for _ in range(2):\n",
    "       process = Process(target=square_numbers, args=(shared_numbers,))\n",
    "       processes.append(process)\n",
    "       process.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "   for process in processes:\n",
    "       process.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(\"Shared numbers:\", shared_numbers[:])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a regular Python list named `numbers` is created with some initial values. The `Array` class is then used to create a shared array named `shared_numbers` of type integer ('i'), initialized with the values from `numbers`. The `square_numbers` function is defined to square each element of the shared array. Two processes are created, and each process calls the `square_numbers` function, passing the shared array as an argument. After the processes finish, the final contents of the shared array are printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `Value` and `Array` provide a convenient way to share data between processes. However, it's important to ensure proper synchronization and coordination when multiple processes access or modify the shared memory to avoid race conditions or data corruption."
