    "### Creating threads in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can create threads using the `threading` module. Here are two other examples of creating threads in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Using a Function as the Thread Target\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_numbers() -> None:\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "        time.sleep(0.1)\n",
    "        print(\"Thread 1:\", i)\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_letters() -> None:\n",
    "    for char in 'ABCDE':\n",
    "        time.sleep(0.1)\n",
    "        print(\"Thread 2:\", char)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create thread objects\n",
    "thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)\n",
    "thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start the threads\n",
    "thread1.start()\n",
    "thread2.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "current_thread_name = threading.current_thread().name\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f'Number of threads running: {threading.active_count()}')\n",
    "print(f'The current thread name: {current_thread_name}')\n",
    "print('----------')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for threads to finish\n",
    "thread1.join()\n",
    "thread2.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "print('----------')\n",
    "print(\"Cell exiting.\")\n",
    "print(f'Number of threads running: {threading.active_count()}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through the code step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code begins by importing the necessary modules: `threading` and `time`. The `threading` module provides functionality for creating and managing threads, while the `time` module is used for introducing delays in the execution of the threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Two functions are defined: `print_numbers()` and `print_letters()`. These functions will be executed concurrently by different threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `print_numbers()` function uses a loop to iterate from 1 to 5. Within each iteration, it introduces a small delay of 0.1 seconds using `time.sleep(0.1)`. It then prints the current value of the loop variable `i` along with the thread name.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The `print_letters()` function iterates over the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E'. Similar to `print_numbers()`, it introduces a small delay of 0.1 seconds using `time.sleep(0.1)` and prints the current character along with the thread name.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Two thread objects, `thread1` and `thread2`, are created using the `threading.Thread` class. The `target` parameter is set to the respective functions they should execute (`print_numbers` and `print_letters`).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The threads are started by calling their `start()` methods. This initiates the execution of the functions `print_numbers()` and `print_letters()` in separate threads concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The code then retrieves the number of active threads using `threading.active_count()` and assigns it to the variable `threads_count`. It also retrieves the name of the current thread using `threading.current_thread().name` and assigns it to `current_thread_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The number of active threads and the current thread name are printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. A separator line is printed for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. The `join()` method is called on both thread objects. This ensures that the main thread waits for `thread1` and `thread2` to complete their execution before proceeding further. Essentially, the program waits for both threads to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Another separator line is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. The program prints a message indicating that the cell is exiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Finally, the number of active threads is printed again using `threading.active_count()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this code demonstrates how to create and start multiple threads in Python using the `threading` module. It prints numbers and letters concurrently from two separate threads and waits for both threads to finish using the `join()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Using a Class as the Thread Target\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n",
    "    def run(self) -> None:\n",
    "        for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "            print(\"Thread:\", i)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create thread object\n",
    "thread = MyThread()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start the thread\n",
    "thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for the thread to finish\n",
    "thread.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Cell exiting.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a custom class `MyThread` that inherits from `threading.Thread`. We override the `run()` method, which will be executed when the thread starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the `run()` method, we perform a task of printing numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create an instance of the `MyThread` class, `thread`, and start it using the `start()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the previous example, we call `join()` to wait for the thread to finish before the main thread exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we print a message to indicate the end of the main thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "By running these examples, you should observe the concurrent execution of multiple threads, each performing its designated task."

    "### Passing arguments to Thread functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can pass arguments to functions in threads using various techniques. There are two common methods: using the `args` parameter of the `Thread` class and using lambda functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the `args` parameter of the `Thread` class:\n",
    "   The `Thread` class from the `threading` module provides an `args` parameter that allows you to pass arguments to the target function when creating a new thread. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   def my_function(arg1, arg2):\n",
    "       # Your function code here\n",
    "\n",
    "   thread = threading.Thread(target=my_function, args=(arg1_value, arg2_value))\n",
    "   thread.start()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `target` parameter is set to the function `my_function`, and the `args` parameter is set to a tuple `(arg1_value, arg2_value)` containing the values you want to pass as arguments to `my_function`. When you start the thread using `thread.start()`, the function `my_function` will be executed in a separate thread with the specified arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using lambda functions:\n",
    "   Another approach is to use lambda functions to encapsulate the function call with the desired arguments. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   def my_function(arg1, arg2):\n",
    "       # Your function code here\n",
    "\n",
    "   thread = threading.Thread(target=lambda: my_function(arg1_value, arg2_value))\n",
    "   thread.start()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we define a lambda function that calls `my_function` with the desired arguments `arg1_value` and `arg2_value`. The lambda function is then passed as the `target` parameter to the `Thread` constructor. When you start the thread, the lambda function will be executed, which in turn calls `my_function` with the specified arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods allow you to pass arguments to functions in threads effectively. Choose the one that suits your needs and coding style."

    "### Retrieving the result of a computation performed in a thread\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve the result of a computation performed in a thread, you can use the `Thread` class from the `threading` module in combination with the `join()` method and a shared data structure like a queue. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",

    "import threading\n",

    "    # Your function code here\n",

    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create and start the thread\n",
    "thread = threading.Thread(target=thread_function, args=(10, 20))\n",

    "\n",
    "# Wait for the thread to finish\n",
    "thread.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Retrieve the result from the queue\n",
    "result = result_queue.get()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a `Queue` object called `result_queue` to store the result of the computation performed in the thread. Inside the `thread_function`, we execute the computation and put the result into the queue using `result_queue.put(result)`. After starting the thread and waiting for it to finish using `thread.join()`, we retrieve the result from the queue using `result_queue.get()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a shared data structure like a queue, you can safely pass the result from the thread to the main program."
